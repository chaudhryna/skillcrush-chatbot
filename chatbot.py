Once a grand mansion, it now sits abandoned, its windows broken, its once-luxurious gardens now a tangle of weeds and ivy. The house is said to be haunted, its halls echoing with the whispers of a tragic past.
 
When seventeen-year-old Mia Alvarez moves to Astoria with her family, she is immediately drawn to the mystery of the old house. Despite the warnings of her new friends, Mia becomes determined to uncover the truth behind the rumors that surround it."""
